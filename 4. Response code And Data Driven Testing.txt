Here we want to create a "Post" request so that can add more Person details
For each details, will add "Name" and "Job" information
Will add the data from a "Csv" file so put multiple data into a CSV file

--> Now Create a "New Collection"
--> Make a HTTP "Post" request
--> Insert the "URL"
--> Write the following code into "Body" -> Row section
	{
		"name": "{{name}}"	// "{{name}}" it's the label of the CSV file
		"job": "{{job}}"	// "{{job}}" it's the label of the CSV file
	}

--> For checking the "Status" code write the following code into the "Scripts-> Post-req" menu
	pm.test("Status code is 201", function () {
    		pm.response.to.have.status(201);
	});

N.B: We can directly get the code from the induild code section which mentioned as 
"Status code: Code is 200"

--> Go to "Run Collection" dashboard. 
--> Select "Run Manually"
--> Upload the "Cas" file and "Run"

It will show the result in description.
