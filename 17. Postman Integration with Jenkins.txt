******** Create a Jenkin job **********
In Jenkins, new project called "job"
-> Create a job by clicking on "New item" menu.
-> Set the "Job Name"
-> Select "Freestyle project"
-> Then "Ok" and will take to the "General" dashboard

On the "General" dashboard folow below steps:
-> Put some description (Optional)
-> Select "Provide Node & npm bin/ folder to PATH" from the "Build Environment" section
-> "Add build step" --> "Execute Windows batch command"  (From the "Build Steps" section)
-> Write the Newman commands in the "Command" box which we usually write in "CMD" for Newman
-> "Apply" --> "Save"


-> Go the the "Job" from the Jenkins dashboard and run "Build Now"
-> Open the last "Build" from the Build History --> Go to "Consol Output" --> View as plain text (To see the execution result)



N.B: If "Newman" do not recgonize by the "Jenkin Command line" See the solution here
