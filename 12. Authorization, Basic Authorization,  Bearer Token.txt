*********** What is Authentication and Authorization

For example:A employee first need to access a office and then will be able to get access of specific stuff

Authentication is like "Who you are" 	(Need to prove you are the employer)
Authorization is like "What you can do"	(What permission you have to do in the office)


******* Basic Authorization ******
For Basic Authorization we need "Username" and "Password" 
From the "Auth Type" section need to select "Basic Auth"

****** Bearer Authorization ******
For Bearer Authorization we need the "Token"
From the "Auth Type" section, need to select "Bearer Token"
